# SPA-GUI
This is one part of the Handheld Console project, a topic we chose for the Students' Professional Activities 2022.

The GUI would be launched right after boot, with a basic loading screen covering the initialisation processes. Retropie, game Bullet Hell, and other custom application could be chosen from the menu. Required application metatdata can be found in the Options folder.
